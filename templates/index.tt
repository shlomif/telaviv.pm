                            <p>Our next meeting will be held on Wednesday, May 22nd!<br/>
                            <b>Yeda Am 8 (Mitchel Building)</b><br/>
                            <b>Room 2103</b></p>

                            <p>Two talks, and an emotional farewell to our fearless leader who is moving from TelAviv.pm to Amsterdam.pm.</p>

                            <h4>Asynchronous Programming FTW! :: Sawyer X</h4>
                            <p>The new age is all about non-blocking asynchronous creative responsive deconstructive refactored decoupled conjectured applications. If you're not on the event loop wagon loop, you're missing out!</p>

                            <p>What the hell am I talking about? Am I just drunk? How many of the above words are totally made-up? These questions and more will be answered at this talk!</p>

                            <h4>Rx.pl - Reactive Extensions for Perl :: Ran Eilam</h4>

                            <p><a href="https://github.com/eilara/Rx.pl">github.com/eilara/Rx.pl</a></p>

                            <p>A library for composing async programs. Because writing async code is hard, but working with Perl lists is easy. Lets turn events into lists, and reap the benefits:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Elegant async programming without callback nesting, using operators we all know from working with Perl lists</li>

                                <li>Managing and coordinating events, e.g. start an HTTP request when timeout on key press if previous HTTP request was OK and arrived in the last 10 seconds</li>

                                <li>Programming with stream transformations, instead of objects and methods-say hello to beautiful functional designs with well defined state and side-effects. Replace boring UML diagrams with fun marble diagrams</li>

                                <li>Stop writing and rewriting retry, timeout, throttle, buffer, window, counters, caching, and aggregate functions for each project. Instead create your processes as observables, then enjoy a rich library of existing operators</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Perl Mongers</h3>
                            <p>The group organizes social events centered around Perl in the greater Tel Aviv, Israel area. We have talks, lectures, and casual meetings. Come meet fellow Perl (and non-Perl) geeks, share a snack, and have some laughs!</p>
                            <p><strong>(The meetings are suitable for beginner, intermediate and advanced developers)</strong></p>

                            <h3>Location</h3>
                            <p>All meetings take place at <strong>Shenkar College, Anna Frank 12, Ramat Gan</strong>!<br/>
                            We get together at <strong>6:30pm</strong>, and talks begin at <strong>7:00pm</strong>.</p>
